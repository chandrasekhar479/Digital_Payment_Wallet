Directory Structure Explanation
1. /src
This is the main source directory where all the application code resides. It contains subdirectories for different aspects of the application, promoting separation of concerns.

/controllers

This directory contains the controller files that handle incoming requests and define the business logic for the application. Each controller corresponds to a specific feature of the digital wallet.
authController.js: Manages user authentication, including registration, login, and token generation.
walletController.js: Handles wallet-related operations such as adding funds, withdrawing funds, and checking balances.
transactionController.js: Manages transaction-related operations, including creating, processing, and retrieving transactions.
/models

This directory contains the Mongoose models that define the structure of the data stored in the MongoDB database. Each model corresponds to a specific entity in the application.
User .js: Defines the schema for user data, including fields like username, email, password, and wallet balance.
Wallet.js: (If separate from User) Defines the schema for wallet data, including user references and balance.
Transaction.js: Defines the schema for transaction data, including user references, transaction amount, type, and timestamp.
/routes

This directory contains the route definitions for the application. Each file defines the API endpoints and associates them with the appropriate controller functions.
authRoutes.js: Defines routes for authentication-related operations (e.g., login, registration).
walletRoutes.js: Defines routes for wallet-related operations (e.g., add funds, withdraw).
transactionRoutes.js: Defines routes for transaction-related operations (e.g., create transaction, get transaction history).
/services

This directory contains service files that encapsulate business logic and external integrations. This promotes reusability and separation of concerns.
emailService.js: Handles email notifications, such as sending transaction confirmations or alerts.
paymentGatewayService.js: Manages interactions with external payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) for processing payments.
/middlewares

This directory contains middleware functions that can be used in the request-response cycle. Middleware functions can perform tasks such as authentication, error handling, and logging.
authMiddleware.js: Checks if a user is authenticated before allowing access to certain routes.
errorMiddleware.js: Centralized error handling middleware that catches errors and sends appropriate responses.
/config

This directory contains configuration files for the application, such as database connection settings and server configurations.
dbConfig.js: Contains the configuration for connecting to the MongoDB database.
serverConfig.js: Contains configuration settings for the Express server, such as port number and environment variables.
app.js

This file is responsible for setting up the Express application, including middleware, routes, and error handling. It serves as the main application file that initializes the server.
server.js

This file is the entry point of the application. It typically imports the app.js file and starts the server, listening for incoming requests.
2. /tests
This directory contains test files for the application. Each file is responsible for testing a specific feature or module of the application, ensuring that the code behaves as expected.

authTests.js: Contains unit and integration tests for authentication-related functionalities.
walletTests.js: Contains tests for wallet-related functionalities.
transactionTests.js: Contains tests for transaction-related functionalities.
3. package.json
This file contains metadata about the project, including the project name, version, description, and dependencies. It is used by npm (Node Package Manager) to manage the project's packages and scripts.

4. README.md
This file provides documentation for the project. It typically includes an overview of the project, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and any other relevant information for developers or users.

Summary
The directory structure of the /digital-wallet project is designed to facilitate the development of a scalable and maintainable digital wallet application. By organizing the code into distinct directories for controllers, models, routes, services, middlewares, and configuration, the project promotes a clean architecture that is easy to navigate and extend. This structure also supports best practices in software development, such as separation of concerns, modularity, and testability.
