Challenge Summary: DIGITAL WALLET
A Digital Wallet is a system that allows users to securely store and manage payment information (e.g., funds, cards, or other payment credentials) to facilitate seamless transactions. This project requires a robust backend system to handle user authentication, transaction management, wallet services, and API integrations, ensuring a secure and smooth user experience.

Other Considerations and Optional Features
Security:

Implement encryption for sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment information).
Use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS, TLS).
Enforce strong user authentication mechanisms such as two-factor authentication (2FA).
Scalability:

Design the system to handle a high volume of concurrent transactions.
Optimize database queries and implement caching for frequently accessed data.
Reliability:

Ensure high availability with fault-tolerant architecture (e.g., load balancing, backups).
Implement transaction rollbacks for failed operations.
User Experience:

Provide detailed transaction logs and notifications.
Offer multi-currency support or localization for global users.
Optional Features:

Integrate rewards or loyalty programs.
Provide analytics dashboards for users to track spending habits.
Enable offline access for wallet information (read-only).
Additional Features
User Authentication:

Registration/Login: Support email, phone, or third-party OAuth providers (Google, Facebook).
Session Management: Implement JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure token-based authentication.
Password Management: Use bcrypt for hashing passwords before storing them.
Transaction Management:

Support for adding funds, transferring funds, and withdrawing funds.
Transaction validation to ensure accurate balances.
Maintain a transaction history for user reference.
Wallet Services:

Real-time wallet balance updates.
Support for linking bank accounts or cards.
Add funds using APIs from payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, Razorpay).
API Integrations:

Payment gateway APIs for processing external payments.
Notification services (e.g., Twilio for SMS, email notifications).
Currency conversion APIs for multi-currency transactions.
Details of Implementation
1. Backend Framework:
The backend system is built using:

Node.js: For non-blocking, event-driven server-side processing.
Express.js: To handle routing, middleware, and API endpoints efficiently.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing structured and unstructured data like user details, transactions, and wallet balances.
2. Key Modules:

Authentication Module: Handles user sign-up/login, password recovery, and token generation.
Wallet Module: Manages user balances, fund addition, and payments.
Transaction Module: Handles CRUD operations for transactions and manages integrity checks.
Notification Module: Sends alerts or updates for transactions and account activities.
3. Tools/Technologies:

Mongoose: For Object Data Modeling (ODM) with MongoDB.
Nodemailer/Twilio: For email/SMS notifications.
Jest/Mocha: For testing the backend codebase.
Description of Data
Users:

Fields: id, name, email, passwordHash, phone, walletId, createdAt, updatedAt.
Wallet:

Fields: walletId, userId, balance, currency, createdAt, updatedAt.
Transactions:

Fields: transactionId, walletId, type (credit/debit), amount, status, timestamp.
APIs:

Fields: apiName, apiKey, usageLimits.
Writing Clean, Scalable, and Well-Tested Code
Clean Code:

Use meaningful variable and function names.
Follow modular coding practices (separate authentication, transactions, and wallet services).
Adhere to coding standards such as ESLint or Prettier.
Scalability:

Use a microservices architecture for large-scale deployments.
Implement horizontal scaling with containerized environments (e.g., Docker and Kubernetes).
Well-Tested Code:

Write unit tests for core functionalities (e.g., authentication, transaction logic).
Perform integration tests for API endpoints.
Automate testing pipelines with CI/CD tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions.
Implementation Details
API Endpoints:

POST /register: For user registration.
POST /login: For user login and token generation.
GET /wallet: Fetch wallet details.
POST /wallet/add-funds: Add funds to the wallet.
POST /wallet/transfer: Transfer funds between wallets.
GET /transactions: Fetch transaction history.
Middleware:

Authentication Middleware: Validates JWT tokens for protected routes.
Error Handling Middleware: Manages exceptions and sends user-friendly error messages.
