 Developed a robust backend system for a payment platform using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, ensuring secure and efficient transaction processing.

Backend System: This refers to the server-side infrastructure responsible for handling requests, processing data, and managing business logic for the payment platform.

Node.js: A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on the server. It's known for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it ideal for real-time applications like payment platforms.

Express: A web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies routing, middleware handling, and overall server logic, enabling a clean and organized codebase for managing HTTP requests and responses.

MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store data like user information, wallet balances, and transaction histories. It provides scalability and flexibility in managing diverse datasets.

Secure and Efficient Transaction Processing: The system is designed to handle transactions quickly and protect sensitive information (e.g., card details, wallet balances). Security measures could include encryption, authentication, and fraud detection mechanisms.

2. Implemented features for user authentication, transaction management, and wallet services, integrating with various APIs for seamless payment experiences.

User Authentication: This involves verifying users' identities using methods like email/password combinations, OTPs, or third-party login options (e.g., Google Sign-In). Authentication ensures only authorized users access their accounts.

Transaction Management: Handling the lifecycle of financial transactions, including initiating, processing, recording, and confirming payments. It involves ensuring accurate debits and credits in wallets or linked accounts.

Wallet Services: Features that allow users to add funds, check balances, or make payments directly from a digital wallet. This is a core component of the payment platform.

Integrating with Various APIs: APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) from third-party services like payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal), banks, or financial institutions are used to handle external payment processing, currency conversion, or notifications.

Seamless Payment Experiences: The integration and system design ensure users can make payments easily without errors or delays. It aims for a smooth user journey, from logging in to completing a transaction.
